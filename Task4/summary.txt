Using the Excel spreadsheet, the two elements I focused on were perimeter and concavity mean
I find a correlation between benign and malignant tumors.
I found a very interesting statistic. There is benign tumors with concavity of .4 in concavity mean.
An interesting correlation, the 0.4108 concavity mean had one of the lowest perimeter means so the high concavity balanced out.
